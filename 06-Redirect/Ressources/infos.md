## How did we found it
Site uses a redirect page `/index.php?page=redirect&site=xxxxx`

Obtained by changing the site in the redirections on the site footer with something invalid.

## How to fix it
- check if link is correct before loading the redirection page
- directly link social network to the icons and don't use a redirect url
